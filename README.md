## Gitano CLI

#### A CLI tool for automatic project setup

Gitano will launch a CLI app that will prompt the user a series of steps to help with a project layout and folder structure.

**Install**  
`npm install -g gitano-cli`

**Run**  
*From the root of your project*
`gitano`

Gitano-Cli will prompt:  

1 - **What do you want to work on?**
* Node CLI app
* Vanilla Website (html - js - sass? postcss?)
* React (webpack - babel - eslint - sass? postcss?)
* React + Redux (webpack - babel - eslint - sass? postcss?)

2 - **What testing suite do you want to use?**
* Mocha
* Mocha + Chai
* AVA

3 - **Extras?**
* React-drops (drops react components from the cli)
